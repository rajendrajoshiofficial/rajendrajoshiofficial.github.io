<h1>How Small Habits Change Your Life</h1>

<p><b>By Rajendra Joshi</b> | 27 Dec 2025</p>

<p>Success in life does not come from big decisions, but from small daily habits.
Waking up early, reading daily, exercising, and thinking positively slowly build
your future. These simple habits create discipline, focus and confidence.</p>

<p>When you improve yourself by just 1% every day, after one year you become a completely
new person. This is the true power of small habits.</p>

<p>Start today. Start small. Stay consistent.</p>
